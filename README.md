# Trufla-Challenge-Task
I had worked on the senior full stack challenge task , I started with desktop and i followed the design as much as i can on fonts, spaces and layout 
on this task i had used HTML,CSS,Jquery for bootstrap and Bootstrab.
there are some points was so simple and easy but i had a challenge on burger menu layout on mobile and tablet 
at the end 
i am looking for working with company and increase my skill scale with you to be more proffessional.
